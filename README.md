- A bit more about me:
I am a HS student, aged 15 from London, England. 
Lived in Spain for most of my childhood but recently moved to Thailand. 
I enjoy tech related stuff and would like to dive deeper into the "behin the scenes" segment of computers. 
Aside from tech, I practice guitar regularly and work out regularly to keep a balance.
